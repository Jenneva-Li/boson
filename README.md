<p>The Boson is an upcoming customizable open source XR headset by <a href="https://www.walkerindustries.xyz/index.html">Wire; Walker Industries Research and Experimentation</a>, an R&D company based in Miami Gardens, Florida, United States.</p>

## Design[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aregtech/areg-sdk/master/docs/img/pin.svg)](#design)
*  **PseudoPancake Lenses:** The primary goal was to identify a cost-effective design for Pancake Lenses, as most available solutions are either commercially unavailable or too expensive. Through research, it was found that positioning the lens in a specific way enables it to produce clear images at short distances from the screen. This design allows for a compact display without compromising the field of view (FOV). The Boson CAD model was integrates PseudoPancake Lenses.
* **VR gloves:** The VR glove concept aims to replace traditional VR controllers with gloves that allow users to interact with virtual environments through natural hand movements. This design includes creating CAD models for gloves of various sizes to ensure a comfortable fit for different hand sizes, incorporating sensors and actuators to capture and translate hand movements accurately. Below is a CAD model of the index finger, which is a component of the glove. Due to confidentiality, the complete official CAD model of the glove cannot be disclosed until its official release.
